# Network_IDS_ML
Network Intrusion Detection using ML
In this project, we are aiming to build an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect unusual activities (anomalies) in networks. We will be using an extensive dataset that has huge number of records and attributes. This high quality dataset will train our model to be more accurate and work efficiently against detecting different types of attacks. In order to make our IDS more scalable we will focus on dynamic feature selection using Random Forests Classifier. Also, to support faster processing and accuracy in big data IoT environments we will use a combination of Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision Trees. Ultimately, our goal is build an adaptable IDS that can evolve in the future (as new threats arise) by using more comprehensive datasets and better ML algorithms.
